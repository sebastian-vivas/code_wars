// A number m of the form 10x + y is divisible by 7 if and only if x âˆ’ 2y is divisible by 7. In other words, subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits. Continue to do this until a number known to be divisible or not by 7 is obtained; you can stop when this number has at most 2 digits because you are supposed to know if a number of at most 2 digits is divisible by 7 or not.
//
// The original number is divisible by 7 if and only if the last number obtained using this procedure is divisible by 7.
//
// Task:
// Your task is to return to the function seven(m) (m integer >= 0) an array (or a pair,
// depending on the language) of numbers, the first being the last number m with at most 2 digits obtained by your function (this last m will be divisible or not by 7),
// the second one being the number of steps to get the result.

const seven = m => {
  let times = 0
  let result = 0
  let number = String(m)
  while (number.length > 2) {
    times++
    const firstNumber = Number(number.slice(-1))
    const remaining = Number(number.slice(0, number.length - 1))
    result = remaining - 2 * firstNumber
